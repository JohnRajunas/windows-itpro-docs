# Roles and permissions in Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education
The first person to sign in to a Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenant must be a Global Admin of the Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant that is being used to manage the work or school identities of the organization. Once the Global Admin has signed in, they can give permissions to others who will have a role in managing the Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenant that is being configured.

Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education service tenants present a set of user roles that help admins and employees manage access to apps and tasks managed by the service. Employees with these roles will need to use their Azure AD account to access their organization's Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenant. Global Administrators and global user accounts that are used with other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft Azure or Office 365, can sign in to that organization's Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenant. Global user accounts have some permissions in Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenants, and the service presents a set of service specific roles that help IT admins and employees manage access to apps and tasks for an organization's own service tenant.


## Global user account permissions

IT Pros with Global Administrator permissions have full access to manage the Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenant. The user who signs up for a Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenant is granted this Global Admin role. They can do everything allowed by the other roles, and would assign permissions to other employees as a part of the tenant set-up process.


## Billing account roles and permissions

There is a set of roles, referred to as "Billing Account" roles, that is assigned to admins and employees who will use the Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education tenant to buy and manage Microsoft Store apps, and/or administer account details and billing information for an organization. Employees with these roles will need to use their Azure AD account to access the tenant.

This table lists the roles and their permissions.
